# COP3223-HW5
Write a program that implements a simple calculator. First, the user is asked to enter two integers, and your 
code will ask to show either the sum, product, or the result of dividing the first integer entered by the second 
one. Division by zero is to be checked. 

## You are only allowed to use POINTERS!
 For example, if you need to store a float value then you declare a float pointer that you will use to create, using malloc, a memory location to hold your float.
